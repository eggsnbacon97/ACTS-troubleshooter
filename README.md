# ACTS Troubleshooter
A simple .bat troubleshooter for Windows 10 based classrooms.

###### What is ACTS?
ACTS was created (very quickly, might I add) to help automate the troubleshooting process for common sound, video, and networking issues in classrooms.
It is *extremely* simple in its design, so don't expect it to do too much. I wrote this so that some simple fixes could be identified by non-technical users when they are having classroom related issues.

###### So What Can It Do?

- Open sound and volume management, and make helpful suggestions.
- Run a simple networking script (this is literally just ```ipconfig release``` and ```ipconfig renew```)
- Open display settings and point towards a solution, such as extending or duplicating the display.

###### Inside ACTS
When you first run ACTS, it will greet you with a four options, listed below.

- (S)ound
- (D)isplay
- (N)etworking
- (O)ther

*Note that "Other" will not do anything, remember this is aimed at the non-technical*

Then you can simply follow the prompts and go through the troubleshooter, and hopefully identify a simple fix.
